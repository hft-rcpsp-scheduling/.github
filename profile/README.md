## HFT RCPSP Scheduling Group

### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our organization.

This group works for the joint goal to provide an RCPSP algorithms for the Software Project in the Master SoftwareTechnology.
The Software Project is a research project and for educational purposes.

A __Resource-Constraint-Project-Scheduling-Problem (RCPSP)__ is described by certain attributes:

* __Resources__ with limited capacity
* A __Project__ with related jobs
* __Jobs__ with dependencies to each other and the constraint of resource usage
* The __Horizon__ as the maximum timespan when all jobs get appended in a feasible order
* The __Goal__ to create the minimal feasible timespan

We use the dataset of projects from R. Kolisch (http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/data.html).
Alongside the dataset there are record solutions for each project with a minimal timespan found by hundreds of researchers. 
Some of these minimal timespans are optimal solutions and can not be surpassed!
